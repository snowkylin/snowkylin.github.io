# Short Bio

I am a second-year Ph.D. student in [Department of Computer Science](http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/), [University College London](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/), advised by [Prof. Jun Wang](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/Jun.Wang/). Meanwhile, I am a [Google Developers Expert](https://developers.google.com/community/experts/directory/profile/profile-xihan-li) in Machine Learning. I used to be a research intern in Machine Learning Group, [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/). Prior to UCL, I received my M.S. degree of Computer Science from [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn), advised by [Prof. Yunhai Tong](http://www.cis.pku.edu.cn/faculty/system/tongyunhai/tongyunhai.htm). I received my B.Eng. degree of Computer Science with minor certificate of Biological Science from [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn/english), working with [Prof. Xiaogang Jin](https://person.zju.edu.cn/0096364). I was a member of [Chu Kochen Honors College (Mixed Class)](http://ckc.zju.edu.cn/english/).

 My research interests lie on reinforcement learning and multi-agent system, with their application on real-world challanges. Currently, my research focuses on the application of multi-agent reinforcement learning in optimization scenarios.
