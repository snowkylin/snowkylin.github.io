            We proposed a novel sophisticated multi-agents reinforcement learning approach to tackle the imbalance between the resource's supply and demand in logistic networks, which is one of the most important problems in real logistics domain. In particular, inspired by the externalities especially the interactions between resource agents, we introduce an innovative cooperative mechanism for state and reward design that resulting more effective and efficient transportation.<br />

            We developed an easy-to-extend diversity-promoting learning framework named MEMD (Multi-Encoder to Multi-Decoder) for conversational response generation, in which an auxiliary encoder and an auxiliary decoder are introduced to provide necessary training guidance without resorting to extra data or complicating network's inner structure. <br />

            We built a rapid protein detection platform based on aptamer-induced inner-membrane scaffolds dimerization by virtue of bacterial ghost system. When the detection platform was coincubated with two kinds of aptamers targeting two different sites of thrombin, green fluorescence or Î²-lactamase activity were yielded with two different designs. The latter was detected by commercially available testing strips.<br />

# Independent Pet Projects

Building a whole complex software system alone from beginning to end might be the dream of every programmer. I am not the exception even if I do research work most of the time.
